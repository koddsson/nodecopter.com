Nodecopter Reykjavík!
---------------------
Yes! It's happening! We're gonna be hosting nodecopter event in Reykjavík ASAP!
Right now we're in planning mode and you can view our current status on our 
[trello board](https://trello.com/b/6dlFsXmd/nodecopter).


Contributing
------------
Currently it's just me ([@koddsson](https://twitter.com/koddsson)) organizing
the event but I'd love some help! (If you don't use twitter I'm on gmail,
facebook under the same online handle).

What we're currently working on can be viewed on the aforementioned [trello
board](https://trello.com/b/6dlFsXmd/nodecopter).

This site
---------
This page is a slight modification of the official [nodecopter
site](https://nodecopter.com) and because of it some aspects might be a bit
wonky or just flat out won't work. So please feel free to submit issues and PRs
if you hit something wierd. You can view it's source code on
[github](https://github.com/koddsson/nodecopter.com).
